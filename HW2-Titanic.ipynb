    "Overall, only about 38% of the passengers survived. Women and Children had the highest survival rates while men and seniors had the lowest. Wealth and class also mattered, as those in 1st class had a higher survival rate than 3rd class. Passengers travelling with family also had a higher chance of surviving. In summary, survival on the Titanic was strongly effected by gender, age, family ties, and social class. This shows how social structures can impact the effect of a disaster. "
